# cv_app_react

At present, this project feels messy and poorly designed as it's my first react project and is just meant to be getting familiar with it. I don't feel great about how I set up many aspects of the project, so perhaps I'll come back later and redo it once I have a bit more experience with react under my belt. Ultimately, it was a good project to be able to experiment with and think about how to pass props and state and structure components.

The app does work fine, but I'm sure there are better ways of doing it.
